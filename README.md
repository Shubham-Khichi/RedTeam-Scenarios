# Ultimate RedTeam Scenarios

**Why?**: Well if you have ever been in positions of management you are often asked "how much are we secured", "Provide justification for your hiring of extra resources", "At a given moment do you have the test results of xyz assets", etc. All these are difficult questions to answer for any manager or team member. Through years of testing and trying out strategies I have founded these scenarios which will help you provide a **Holistic** coverage for your entire company's infrastructure. By No Means this is an exhaustive list, but thats what we want to achieve, pick a product and create scenarios on how you would threat model it and red team it. Feel free to redact sensitive company data and contribute to this github repo. Whatever you do DUPLICATES are not allowed.
